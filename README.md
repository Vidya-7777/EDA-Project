# **Exploring Health Trends Across the Globe**

## **Overview**
This project aims to analyze global health trends, exploring key indicators such as disease prevalence, healthcare access, mortality rates, and socioeconomic factors that influence public health. By leveraging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques, this project provides meaningful insights into health conditions worldwide, helping researchers and policymakers understand disparities and patterns across different regions.

## **Alignment with SDG Goal 3**
This study supports **United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3: Good Health and Well-Being**, which aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. By analyzing **health data and trends**, the project contributes to informed decision-making, improved healthcare strategies, and efforts to reduce global health inequalities.

## **Key Steps in Data Exploration**
The project follows a structured approach to analyze and transform health-related data:
- **Identification of Variables and Data Types**: Understanding the structure of the dataset.
- **Analyzing Basic Metrics**: Exploring summary statistics to detect anomalies.
- **Univariate Analysis**:
  - **Non-Graphical Methods**: Distribution, central tendency, and dispersion.
  - **Graphical Methods**: Histograms, box plots, and density plots for visualization.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Identifying relationships between different health indicators.
- **Variable Transformations**: Scaling and normalizing data for consistency.
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Addressing incomplete records to ensure data quality.
- **Outlier Detection and Treatment**: Identifying extreme values that could skew analysis.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Evaluating relationships between features to uncover dependencies.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to simplify the dataset while retaining meaningful patterns.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, etc)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (For interactive data exploration)

## **Project Impact**
By providing a data-driven view of global health trends, this project enables researchers, policymakers, and organizations to make informed decisions. The insights derived from this analysis can help improve healthcare systems, allocate resources efficiently, and drive positive change toward achieving **SDG Goal 3**.
